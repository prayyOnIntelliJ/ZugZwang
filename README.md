**ZugZwang** is a strategic, chess-inspired puzzle game focused on tactical positioning, decision pressure, and deliberate play.  
Developed within a **10-week production timeframe** as part of the *School4Games* program, the project emphasizes clean systems, scalable progression, and performance-aware design under real production constraints.

## About the Game

In *ZugZwang*, players face increasingly complex tactical board scenarios where **every move is mandatory and every decision creates a disadvantage somewhere else**.  
The core challenge is not finding a good move—but choosing the least damaging one.

Key features:
- Chess-inspired tactical puzzles  
- Turn-based, deterministic gameplay  
- Progressive difficulty and endless mode  
- Clean, minimal UI focused on decision clarity

## My Role – Game Engineer

I worked as **Game Engineer** in a team of 10 people, contributing across gameplay systems, UI, performance optimization, and production pipelines.

### Core Responsibilities
- Implemented large parts of **player movement and interaction logic**
- Designed and built the **complete UI system** (menus, HUD, progression screens)
- Implemented the **level progression system** including XP and levels
- Developed the **Endless Mode** with scalable difficulty
- Optimized performance with **mobile hardware constraints** in mind
- Set up and maintained the **build pipeline**

### Technical Ownership
- Structured gameplay systems for maintainability and reuse
- Managed board state, rule enforcement, and move validation  
- Built internal debug and helper tools to support iteration and testing  
- Ensured clean repository structure and stable builds throughout production

## Teamwork, Time Pressure & Technical Growth

This project marked my **first experience coding closely with another developer under real time constraints**.  
Within the 10-week timeframe, task separation, communication, and shared ownership were essential to shipping a polished and stable game.

A key takeaway was that **performance is a design constraint, not an afterthought**.  
Targeting mobile early enforced discipline in rendering, memory allocation, and UI complexity, shaping both the technical architecture and gameplay decisions from day one.
